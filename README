Python 3.10+ doesn't work because of some bad version check in one of the dependencies

Currently using 3.9.6

# Start BackEnd (Flask + Postgres)
```
cd postgres
docker-compose up -d --build
```

# Running Flask locally without Docker 
on MacOS you need PostgreSQL from Brew to install psycopg2
```
brew install postgresql
```
